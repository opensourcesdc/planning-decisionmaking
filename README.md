# Planning

`Existing models`: We do not believe in re-inventing the wheel, so we have scoured the web for the best models out there and are building upon them. We are focusing on pushing the frontiers of this technology

`Models`: models we created ourselves, or have adapted for real-life use

`Resources`: presentations, tutorials, courses, papers for learning about the technology
